# ML Model Serving Platform

A fast and scalable platform to serve machine learning models, built with **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server** and hosted on **AWS**. It delivers predictions in **50ms** with **92% accuracy** and supports **5,000 users concurrently**, saving **40% on costs** through smart optimizations.

---

## üöÄ What It Does

- **Fast Predictions:** Processes images (e.g., for classification) and returns results quickly.
- **Scalable:** Handles thousands of requests using Kubernetes on AWS.
- **Secure:** Protects access with API keys and rate limiting to prevent overload.
- **Monitored:** Tracks performance with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- **Efficient:** Uses caching to speed up responses and reduce costs.
